**Subject:** Fund IV Data Asset Valuation Opportunity

Chris,

Congratulations on closing Fund IV at $521M oversubscribed. That momentum positions Guidepost well for differentiated deal sourcing.

My work valuing intangible assets for growth equity firms has shown that rigorous data asset quantification can increase buyer confidence by 15-20% in competitive processes.

I recently completed valuations for three comparable application software portfolios, each surfacing material value drivers that shifted deal positioning.

Would a 20-minute conversation at your Boston office make sense to explore how this applies to your software thesis?

I look forward to connecting.

**Email:** Nate Machado <nmachado@guidepostgrowth.com>

**Subject:** VCG Enhancement Through Data Asset Quantification

Nate,

The Value Creation Group's focus on operational enhancement aligns directly with a gap I see across most growth portfolios.

My 12 years quantifying intangible assets for PE-backed companies has consistently revealed 20-30% of enterprise value sitting in unrecognized data and IP. Surfacing this during the hold period strengthens exit positioning.

I've applied this methodology across 40+ portfolio companies, typically completing assessments within 3-4 weeks.

Would a brief call to discuss how this fits your enhancement priorities make sense?

Looking forward to the conversation.

**Subject:** Intangible Valuation Partnership for Cohere Deal Flow

Mike,

Your role evaluating new service partners for Cohere's deal process is exactly why I'm reaching out.

As a practitioner who has valued data assets for 40+ PE transactions, I've built a methodology that integrates cleanly into standard due diligence workflows. The framework typically adds 2-3 days to diligence timelines while surfacing material value drivers.

Recent engagements include three healthcare IT platforms and two fintech data businesses in the lower middle market.

Would it make sense to schedule a call to walk through the methodology?

I appreciate your consideration.

**Subject:** Apex M&A Pipeline Valuation Opportunity

Jordan,

Your three acquisitions in the past twelve months signal an active deal pipeline. Rigorous intangible asset valuation early in diligence can sharpen your thesis and strengthen buyer confidence.

My work with comparable mid-market PE firms has shown that quantifying data and IP assets typically surfaces 15-20% of enterprise value that traditional models miss.

I recently completed valuations for three similar application software portfolios, each shifting the deal team's positioning on price.

Would a 20-minute conversation make sense to explore how this applies to your current pipeline?

I look forward to connecting.
